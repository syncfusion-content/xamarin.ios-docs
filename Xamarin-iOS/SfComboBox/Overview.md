The ComboBox control allows users to choose an option from a list of predefined options. When the arrow icon accompanying this component is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which users can select an option.

## Key Features

* **ComboBox Mode** - Provides an option to select an item from the dropdown list by either editing or non-editing the ComboBox text box.

* **Suggestion Mode** - Suggestions can be displayed in eight different modes, such as StartsWith, EndsWith, Contains, Equals, etc.

* **Multiple Selection** - Provides two different ways to select multiple items from the dropdown list using token representation and delimiter.

* **Filtering** - Provides options to support both filtering and non-filtering suggestion lists. The ComboBox provides three different ways to display the filtered suggestions: displaying suggestions using the dropdown list, appending the first suggestion to text, and both of these combined.

* **Header and Footer** - Header and footer content can be added to the top and bottom of the dropdown list.

* **Text Highlighting** - Highlights the matching text in the dropdown list based on the input.

* **Customization Support** - Provides options to customize both the entry field and dropdown.

* **Watermark** – Supports explanatory text inside the ComboBox control until users input text. The watermark is restored if the user clears the text.
