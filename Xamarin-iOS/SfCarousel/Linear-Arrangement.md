# The Carousel Linear Arrangement

The Carousel items can be populated in the view in a stacked linear layout by setting the `ViewMode` property to Linear. The present option is `Default`.

{% highlight C# %}

SfCarousel carousel = new SfCarousel();
carousel.ViewMode = SFCarouselViewMode.SFCarouselViewModeLinear;

{% endhighlight %}
