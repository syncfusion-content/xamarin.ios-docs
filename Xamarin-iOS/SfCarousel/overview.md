# Overview With SfCarousel

SfCarousel control is one of the patterns for browsing a small collection of featured products. The viewer is able to view several images of products across a row, and they can swipe horizontally across the row to navigate to the next set of products. They provide a 2-D interface for displaying objects with interactive navigation. It also works for a wide variety of device sizes and screen resolutions.

* `Rotation Angle` - It is used to rotate all the items to a specified angle.
