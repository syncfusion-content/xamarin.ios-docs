# Selection

Dates can be selected by making a touch on month view cells. The default [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfCalendar.iOS.SFCalendar.html#Syncfusion_SfCalendar_iOS_SFCalendar_SelectionMode) is Single which allows user to select one date at a time. SfCalendar provides support to select dates in three modes such as single, multiple and range selection.

* `SingleSelection` – A single date can be selected in a month view which can be equipped when user needs to select one date at a time / to view events.

* `MultiSelection` – More than one date can be selected in a random manner. Clicking again on selected dates can do deselection.

* `RangeSelection` – Range of dates can be selected by dragging on the date cells.

* `MultiRangeSelection` – More than one date range can be selected in a month view.


N> The selected dates can be retrieved through `CalendarTapped` Delegate which is raised on selecting.
