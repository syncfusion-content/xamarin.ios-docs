# Selection changed

The selection changed event occurs when changing from one segment item to another in the segmented control. It can be handled in two ways.

## User interface

When users navigate from one item to another, selection is changed, so that the `SelectedIndex` value is updated to a new index of the item. The segmented control provides the `SelectionChanged` event, which occurs when selection is changed with `SelectionChangedEventArgs`.

`Index` - Gets the current index value of the selected item.

{% highlight c# %}
SfSegmentedControl segmentedControl = new SfSegmentedControl();
segmentedControl.SelectionChanged += (object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e) =>
{
segmentedControl.BorderColor = UIColor.Red;
};
{% endhighlight %}

## Selected index programmatically

Users can set the default value programmatically for selection to be placed. The selection is updated based on the index value given for `SelectedIndex`. 

{% highlight c# %}
SfSegmentedControl segmentedControl = new SfSegmentedControl();
segmentedControl.SelectedIndex = 2;
{% endhighlight %}
