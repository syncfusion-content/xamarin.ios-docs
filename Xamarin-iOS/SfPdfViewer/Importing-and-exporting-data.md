# Importing and exporting data

PDF Viewer provides options to import and export data like form fields and annotations in the PDF document.

## Importing and exporting form data

The import and export of form data supports the following extensions.

* fdf
* xfdf
* json
* xml

The required file type can be chosen from the `DataFormat` enumeration. In the following sections only the fdf file type is explained for brevity.

### Exporting form data 

The `ExportFormData` method exports the current data filled in the form fields into a stream in the specified file format. The name of the PDF (with extension) from which the data are exported should be given as the second argument to the method.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Export form data to "fdf" data format
Stream fdfStreamToSave = pdfViewerControl.ExportFormData(DataFormat.Fdf, "PdfFileName.fdf");

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N>While saving the stream returned by the `ExportFormData` method, the file name must have the same extension as the file type that was given as the first argument. For example, in the above case the file type provided is `fdf`, so the saved file extension should be `.fdf`.

### Importing form data

The `ImportFormData` method imports the data from a file of specified type and fills the saved data into the form fields.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Import form data from "fdf" data format
Stream fdfStreamToImport = typeof(App).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("SampleDefaultNamespace.Assets.PdfFileName.fdf");
pdfViewerControl.ImportFormData(fdfStreamToImport, DataFormat.Fdf);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Importing and exporting annotations

The import and export of annotations support following extensions.

* fdf
* xfdf

The required file type can be chosen from the `DataFormat` enumeration. In the following sections only the fdf file type is explained for brevity.

### Exporting annotations

The `ExportAnnotations` method exports the current annotations added to the document into a stream in the specified file format. The name of the PDF (with extension) from which the annotations are exported should be given as the second argument to the method.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Export annotations to "fdf" data format
Stream fdfStreamToSave = pdfViewerControl.ExportAnnotations(AnnotationDataFormat.Fdf, "PdfFileName.fdf");

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N>While saving the stream returned by the `ExportAnnotations` method, the file name must have the same extension as the file type that was given as the first argument. e.g. In the above case the file type provided is `fdf`, so the saved file extension should be `.fdf`.

### Importing annotations

The `ImportAnnotations` method imports the annotations from the file of specified type and fills the saved annotations into the loaded PDF document.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Import annotations from "fdf" data format
Stream fdfStreamToImport = typeof(App).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("SampleDefaultNamespace.Assets.PdfFileName.fdf");
pdfViewerControl.ImportAnnotations(fdfStreamToImport, AnnotationDataFormat.Fdf);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
