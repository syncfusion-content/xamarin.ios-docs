# Overview

Pop-up layout provides a layout that allows users to display an alert message with customizable buttons or load any desired view inside a pop-up. It provides options to fully customize the pop-up with custom header, body, and footer capabilities, allowing you to display important information to use precisely how user want to.

## Key features

* Load complex views and layouts as content.
* Display pop-ups with minimalistic code by calling only a single method.
* Choose from default layouts, such as one-button layout and two-button layout, to display simple and minimalistic information.
* Display pop-ups in positions relative to a view on the screen.
* Display pop-ups on the touch interaction positions.
* Display pop-ups at specific x and y coordinates with desired height and width or with default dimensions in the center.
