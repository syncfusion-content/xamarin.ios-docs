# Appointments

[ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html) is a class, which holds the details about the appointment to be rendered in schedule. It has some basic properties such as [StartTime](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_StartTime), [EndTime](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_EndTime), [Subject](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_Subject) and some additional information about the appointment can be added using [AppointmentBackground](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_AppointmentBackground), [Notes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_Notes), [Location](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_Location), [All Day](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_IsAllDay), [Recurring properties](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.RecurrenceProperties.html).

## Mapping
Schedule supports full data binding to any type of IEnumerable source. Specify the [AppointmentMapping](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.AppointmentMapping.html) attributes to map the properties in the underlying data source to the schedule appointments.

| PropertyName | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

>**NOTE**
CustomAppointment class should contain two NSDate fields and a NSString field as mandatory.
 
### Creating custom Appointments
You can create a custom class `Meeting` with mandatory fields 	`From`, `To`, `EventName`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
/// <summary>   
/// Represents custom data properties.   
/// </summary> 
public class Meeting
{
	public NSString EventName { get; set; }
	public NSDate From { get; set; }
	public NSDate To { get; set; }
	public UIColor Color { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

>**NOTE**
You can inherit this class from `INotifyPropertyChanged` for dynamic changes in Custom data.

You can map those properties of `Meeting` class with our SfSchedule control by using [AppointmentMapping](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.SfSchedule.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_SFSchedule_AppointmentMapping).

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
/// <summary>   
/// Represents custom data properties.   
/// </summary> 
 AppointmentMapping mapping = new AppointmentMapping();
 mapping.Subject = "EventName";
 mapping.StartTime = "From";
 mapping.EndTime = "To";
 mapping.AppointmentBackground = "Color";
 schedule.AppointmentMapping = mapping;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

You can schedule meetings for a day by setting `From` and `To` of `Meeting` class. Create meetings of type `ObservableCollection <Meeting>` and assign those appointments collection `Meetings` to the `ItemsSource` property which is of `IEnumerable` type.

// Adding custom appointments in DataSource of SfSchedule
schedule.ItemsSource = Meetings;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}


## Spanned Appointments
Spanned Appointment is an appointment which lasts more than 24 hours. It doesn’t block out time slots in `SfSchedule`,it will render in [All-Day appointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ios/sfschedule/data-bindings#all-day-appointment-panel) panel exclusively.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
using Foundation;
using Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS;

//Creating an instance for SfSchedule control

});

//Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection
schedule.Appointments = appCollection;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

![spanning or multiday appointments in schedule Xamarin iOS](data_binding_images/span.png)

## All Day Appointments
All-Day appointment is an appointment which is scheduled for a whole day. It can be set by using `IsAllDay` property in the `ScheduleAppointment`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
//Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection
appCollection.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
{
    StartTime = startDate,
    EndTime = endDate,
    Subject = (NSString)"Client Meeting",
    Location = (NSString)"Hutchison road",
    AppointmentBackground = UIColor.Red,
    IsAllDay = true
});
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

>**NOTE**
Appointment which lasts through an entire day (exact 24 hours) will be considered as all day appointment without setting `IsAllDay` property. For example  06/09/2018 12:00AM to 06/10/2018 12:00AM.

### All-Day Appointment Panel
All-day appointment and Spanned appointment doesn't block out entire time slot in SfSchedule, rather it will render in separate layout exclusively for all-day appointment. It can be enabled by setting `ShowAllDay` property of `DayViewSettings`, `WeekViewSettings` and `WorkWeekViewSettings` of `DayView`, `WeekView` and `WorkWeekView` respectively.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
//Setting Schedule View
schedule.ScheduleView = SFScheduleView.SFScheduleViewDay;

//Creating Week View Settings for SfSchedule WeekView
WeekViewSettings weekViewSettings = new WeekViewSettings();
weekViewSettings.ShowAllDay = true;
schedule.WeekViewSettings = weekViewSettings;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

>**NOTE**
Appointments which lasts less than 24 hours with different start date and end date will be rendered in time slot.

All-Day panel background can be customized by setting `AllDayAppointmentLayoutColor` 
of the respective view settings.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
weekViewSettings.AllDayAppointmentLayoutColor = UIColor.Gray;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Recurrence Appointment
Recurring appointment on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly interval. Recurring appointments can be created by setting `RecurrenceRule` property in Schedule appointments.

### Recurrence Rule
The `RecurrenceRule` is a string value, that contains the details of the recurrence appointments like repeat type - daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, how many times it needs to be repeated, the interval duration and also the time period to render the appointment, etc.
`RecurrenceRule` has the following properties and based on this property value, the recurrence appointments are rendered in the SfSchedule control with its respective time period.

| PropertyName | Purpose |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FREQ | Maintains the Repeat type value of the appointment. (Example: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Every week day) Example: FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1 |
| INTERVAL | Maintains the interval value of the appointments. For example, when you create the daily appointment at an interval of 2, the appointments are rendered on the days Monday, Wednesday and Friday. (creates the appointment on all days by leaving the interval of one day gap) Example: FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1 |
| COUNT | It holds the appointment’s count value. For example, when the recurrence appointment count value is 10, it means 10 appointments are created in the recurrence series. Example: FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10 |
| UNTIL | This property is used to store the recurrence end date value. For example, when you set the end date of appointment as 6/30/2014, the UNTIL property holds the end date value when the recurrence actually ends. Example: FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;UNTIL=8/25/2014 |
| BYDAY | It holds the “DAY” values of an appointment to render.For example, when you create the weekly appointment, select the day(s) from the day options (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday).  When Monday is selected, the first two letters of the selected day “MO” is stored in the “BYDAY” property.  When you select multiple days, the values are separated by commas. Example: FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE;COUNT=10 |
| BYMONTHDAY | This property is used to store the date value of the Month while creating the Month recurrence appointment. For example, when you create a Monthly recurrence appointment in the date 3, it means the BYMONTHDAY holds the value 3 and creates the appointment on 3rd day of every month. Example: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=3;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10 |
| BYMONTH | This property is used to store the index value of the selected Month while creating the yearly appointments. For example, when you create the yearly appointment in the Month June, it means the index value for June month is 6 and it is stored in the BYMONTH field.  The appointment is created on every 6th month of a year. Example: FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTHDAY=16;BYMONTH=6;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10 |
| BYSETPOS | This property is used to store the index value of the week. For example, when you create the monthly appointment in second week of the month, the index value of the second week (2) is stored in BYSETPOS. Example: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO;BYSETPOS=2;UNTIL=8/11/2014 |

### Recurrence Pattern

## Recurrence Pattern Exceptions 
You can delete or change any recurrence pattern appointment by handling exception dates and exception appointments to that recurring appointment.

### Recurrence Exception Dates
You can delete any occurrence appointment which is exception from the recurrence pattern appointment by adding exception dates to the recurring appointment.  

### Recurrence Exception appointment
You can also change any occurrence appointment which is exception from recurrence pattern appointment by adding the recurrence exception appointment in the schedule `ItemsSource`.

### Create recurrence exceptions for schedule appointment

You can add/remove the recurrence exception appointments and recurrence exception dates to `ScheduleAppointment` by using its property, [RecurrenceExceptionDates](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceExceptionDates), [RecurrenceId](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceId), [ExceptionOccurrenceActualDate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_ScheduleAppointment_ExceptionOccurrenceActualDate).

### Customize Font Appearance

You can change the appearance of Font by setting the [TextStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.SFAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_SFAppointmentStyle_TextStyle) property of [AppointmentStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ios/sfschedule/data-bindings#appearance-customization) property in Schedule.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
appointmentStyle.TextStyle = UIFont.FromName("Lobster-Regular",15);
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

![custom font support in schedule Xamarin iOS](data_binding_images/customfontappointment.png)

Refer [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ios/sfschedule/monthview#custom-font-setting-in-xamarinios) to configure the custom fonts in Xamarin.iOS.

## Selection
Schedule control has built-in events to handle tapped, double tapped and long pressed touch actions.

•	[CellTapped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html)
•	[CellDoubleTapped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html)
•	[CellLongPressed](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html)

These events will be triggered while perform respective touch actions in timeslots, month cells and in appointments. All the three events contain the same argument [CellTappedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html) which holds selected appointment and date time details in it.

• [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_CellTappedEventArgs_ScheduleAppointment) -  Contains the selected appointment value, it will be null, if any time slots selected.
• [Date](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.CellTappedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_CellTappedEventArgs_Date) - Contains selected time slot DateTime value.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %} 
schedule.CellTapped += Schedule_CellTapped;
schedule.CellDoubleTapped += Schedule_CellDoubleTapped;
schedule.CellLongPressed += Schedule_CellLongPressed;

...

private void Schedule_CellTapped(object sender, CellTappedEventArgs e)
{
}
private void Schedule_CellDoubleTapped(object sender, CellTappedEventArgs e)
{
}
private void Schedule_CellLongPressed(object sender, CellTappedEventArgs e)
{
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Selection customization
The default selection of an appointment can be customized by using [SelectionBorderColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.SFAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_SFAppointmentStyle_SelectionBorderColor), [SelectionTextColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin-ios/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.iOS.SFAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_SfSchedule_iOS_SFAppointmentStyle_SelectionTextColor) properties in `AppointmentStyle` property of `SfSchedule`. The property is used to customize or override the default selection of the appointments.

N> `BorderWidth` value must be set to highlight `SelectionBorderColor`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %} 
//Creating Appointment style
SFAppointmentStyle appointmentStyle = new SFAppointmentStyle();
appointmentStyle.BorderColor = UIColor.Blue;
appointmentStyle.BorderCornerRadius = 12;
appointmentStyle.BorderWidth = 2;
appointmentStyle.SelectionBorderColor = UIColor.Yellow;
appointmentStyle.SelectionTextColor = UIColor.Yellow;

//Setting Appointment Style
schedule.AppointmentStyle = appointmentStyle;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
