# SfBusyIndicator

SfBusyIndicator makes it easy to let the user know when an application is busy. Simply wrap the relevant content in an instance of the SfBusyIndicator control and toggle its `IsBusy` property to True during any long-running process. The SfBusyIndicator should be used to indicate activity while content is being loaded or the UI is blocked waiting for a resource to become available.

* `Title` – A user customized string is displayed while showing animation.
* `Sizing` – User can customize height and width of the animation.
* `AnimationTypes` – Supports 13 built-in animations that can be set with the control.
