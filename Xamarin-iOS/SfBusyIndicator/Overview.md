# SfBusyIndicator Overview

The SfBusyIndicator control provides an elegant way to indicate when your application is performing time-consuming operations. It displays animated visual feedback to users, letting them know that the application is actively working and hasn't frozen or become unresponsive.
Simply wrap the relevant content in an instance of the SfBusyIndicator control and toggle its `IsBusy` property to `true` during any long-running process. The SfBusyIndicator should be used to indicate activity while content is being loaded, data is being processed, or the UI is blocked waiting for a resource to become available.
