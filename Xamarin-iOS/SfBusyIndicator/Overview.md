# SfBusyIndicator

BusyIndicator makes it easy to let the user know when an application is busy. Simply wrap the relevant content in an instance of the BusyIndicator control and toggle its IsBusy property to True during any long-running process. The busy indicator should be used to indicate activity while content is being loaded or the UI is blocked waiting for a resource to become available.

* `Title` – A user customized string is displayed while showing animation.
* `Sizing` – A user can customize height and width of the animation.
* `AnimationTypes` – There are over 13 built-in animations that can be set with the control.
