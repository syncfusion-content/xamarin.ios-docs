# Overview

The NavigationDrawer is a sliding panel menu that slides out from the screen edge, allowing you to organize content in a hidden panel. The drawer can be revealed by swiping from any of the four screen edges or programmatically on demand, providing an intuitive navigation experience for mobile applications.
