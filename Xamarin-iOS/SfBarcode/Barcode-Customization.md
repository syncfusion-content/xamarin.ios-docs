# Barcode Customization

## Bar Customization

The color of the Barcode can be customized by using the properties of `DarkBarColor` and `LightBarColor` in the SfBarcode. 

The `DarkBarColor` represents the color of the dark bar (Black color by default) and the `LightBarColor` represents the color of the gap between two adjacent black bars (White color by default).


{% highlight c# %}

    //Changes the color of darker area of Barcode.
    barcode.DarkBarColor = UIColor.Blue;
    //Changes the color of lighter area of Barcode.
    barcode.LightBarColor = UIColor.Yellow;

{% endhighlight %}

>**NOTE** The `DarkBarColor` and `LightBarColor` customizations are applicable only for one dimensional Barcodes. In order, to recognize a Barcode symbol by a scanner, there must be an adequate contrast between the dark bars and the light spaces. All the Barcode scanners do not have support for colored Barcodes.

## Text Customization

The text representing the Barcode can be customized by using the following properties.

* The color of text can be altered by using the `TextColor` property.
* The horizontal alignment of text can be customized with the help of the `TextAlignment` property.
* The gap between Barcode and text can be adjusted by setting property of `TextGapHeight`.
* To change the location of text vertically, you can make use of the `TextLocation` property with options of top and bottom location.

{% highlight c# %}

    barcode.TextColor = UIColor.Blue;
    barcode.TextFont = UIFont.BoldSystemFontOfSize (30);
    barcode.TextGapHeight = 20;
    barcode.TextLocation = SFBarcodeTextLocation.SFBarcodeTextLocationBottom;
    barcode.TextAlignment =SFBarcodeTextAlignment.SFBarcodeTextAlignmentCenter;

{% endhighlight %}
