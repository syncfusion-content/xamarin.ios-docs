# Pointers

## BarPointer

Barpointer is an accenting line or colored bar that is placed on the Linear Gauge to mark the values. 

{% highlight c# %}

    BarPointer rangePointer = new BarPointer ();
    rangePointer.Value = 50;
    rangePointer.Color = Color.FromRgb (206, 69, 69);
    rangePointer.Thickness = 10;
    pointers.Add (rangePointer);

{% endhighlight %}

## SymbolPointer

In SymbolPointer, the value is pointed by a symbol on the scale. The Symbol Pointer class is derived from Pointer class. You can modify the symbol pointerâ€™s size using the StrokeWidth property. The color of the symbol pointer is changed using the Color property.

{% highlight c# %}

	List<LinearPointer> pointers = new List<LinearPointer> ();
     //SymbolPointer
    SymbolPointer symbolPointer = new SymbolPointer ();
    symbolPointer.Value = 50;
    symbolPointer.Offset = 0.0;
    symbolPointer.Thickness = 3;
    symbolPointer.Color = Color.FromRgb (65, 77, 79);
    pointers.Add (symbolPointer);
	
{% endhighlight  %}
