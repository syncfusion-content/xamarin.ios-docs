# Looping support in SfPicker

This section will explain about the Looping support in SfPicker control.

## EnableLooping

The looping support is used to automatically navigate the first item to repeat the list of items after reached the last item. Each forward iteration is followed by a backward iteration in the picker control. This can be achieved by `EnableLooping` property.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

picker.EnableLooping = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## How to restrict Looping in a particular column of the picker

The looping support can be restricted in a particular column of the picker by setting the `EnableLooping` of ColumnLoaded event argument to false.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

private void Picker_OnColumnLoaded(object sender, ColumnLoadedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Column == 0)
    {
        e.EnableLooping = true;
    }
    else
        e.EnableLooping = false;
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
