# Overview

The TreeMap control provides a simple yet effective way to visualize flat or hierarchical data as clustered rectangles with a specific weighted attribute that determines the size of the rectangle.

## Key features

* `Level` - Defines the levels for flat and hierarchical data collections.

* `Layout` - Determines the visual representation of nodes belonging to all the levels in TreeMap using the layouts such as Squarified, SliceAndDiceAuto, SliceAndDiceHorizontal, and SliceAndDiceVertical.

* `Visualization for colors` – Customizes the colors of the leaf nodes in TreeMap using color mapping support.

* `Tooltip` – Provides a pop-up like information on tapping the leaf nodes.

* `Selection` – Allows you to select or highlight specific leaf nodes.

* `Legend` – Helps you to relate data with the leaf nodes.

* `DataLabel` – Shows the group path information on the leaf node with Trim, Wrap, and Hide options.

* `Drilldown` – Allows you to explore each level of data in detail by virtualizing a large set of data into minimal views.
