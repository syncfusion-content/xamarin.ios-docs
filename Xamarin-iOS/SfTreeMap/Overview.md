## Key features

* `Levels` - Define the levels for flat and hierarchical data collections.

* `Layouts` - Determine the visual representation of nodes belonging to all the levels in TreeMap using the layouts such as Squarified, SliceAndDiceAuto, SliceAndDiceHorizontal, and SliceAndDiceVertical.

* `Visualization for colors` – Customize the colors of the leaf nodes in tree map using color mapping support.

* `Tooltip` – Provides a pop-up like information on tapping the leaf nodes.

* `Selection` – Allows you to select or highlight specific leaf nodes.

* `Legends` – Helps you to relate data with the leaf nodes.

* `DataLabels` – Show group path information on the leaf node with Trim, Wrap and Hide options.

* `Drilldown` – Allows you to explore each level of data in detail by virtualizing large set of data’s into minimal views.
